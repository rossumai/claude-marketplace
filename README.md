# 🧰 Rossum toolkit for Claude Code

Turn Claude into a Rossum implementation partner — audit hooks, analyze schemas, query Data Storage, extract documents, and generate SOWs, all from your terminal.

8 skills · 9 reference packs · 64 MCP tools — [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for Rossum.ai.

<!-- TODO: add a terminal demo GIF here (e.g. invoice extraction or hook audit) -->

## 🚀 Quick start

You need [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/) and a Rossum API token.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add rossumai/claude-marketplace
/plugin install rossum-sa@rossumai-claude-marketplace
```

Then connect and go:

```
Connect to Rossum (token: <TOKEN>, base URL: https://elis.rossum.ai).
Map out the entire org — workspaces, queues, hooks, schemas — and draw
an ASCII architecture diagram. Add emoji health indicators next to each
component (🟢 healthy, 🟡 warning, 🔴 broken).
```

> **Note:** Auto-updates are off by default for third-party marketplaces. Enable them in `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** tab.

**Optional:** For a better experience when developing and implementing projects, install the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin — it adds structured planning, TDD workflows, and code review skills that pair well with `rossum-sa`:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

### Running from a local checkout (feature branch)

To test a feature branch before it's published to the marketplace, clone the repo and point Claude Code at the plugin directories with `--plugin-dir`.

Example using the [`teamd-hackathon`](https://github.com/rossumai/claude-marketplace/tree/teamd-hackathon) branch:

```bash
git clone -b teamd-hackathon https://github.com/rossumai/claude-marketplace.git rossum-claude-plugin

claude --plugin-dir rossum-claude-plugin/plugins/rossum-sa \
       --plugin-dir rossum-claude-plugin/plugins/nerossum
```

Each `--plugin-dir` loads one plugin; omit the ones you don't need.

## 📚 Autoloaded references

When `rossum-sa` is enabled, Claude automatically gets domain knowledge for:

- **Rossum platform** — queues, schemas, hooks, annotations, workflows
- **MongoDB** — query syntax, aggregation pipelines
- **Master Data Hub (MDH)** — matching, scoring, collections
- **Data Storage API** — CRUD, indexing, search
- **TxScript & Serverless Functions** — formula fields, extension development
- **SAP Integration** — connector setup, mapping
- **Export Pipeline (Request Processor)** — multi-stage API integration engine, SFTP export, auth, response handling
- **Coupa Integration Baseline (CIB)** — schema, MDH matching, export pipeline, business rules
- **prd2 CLI** — deployment and management commands
- **Structured Formats Import (SFI)** — XML/JSON import setup, XPath/JMESPath selectors, e-invoicing (ZUGFeRD, X-Rechnung)

## 💡 What can you do with this?

**🕵️ Who's been busy?** — Pull a year of audit logs and surface suspicious activity patterns.
```
Connect to Rossum (token: <TOKEN>, base URL: https://elis.rossum.ai), pull all audit logs
for the last year, and print a histogram of user activity. Highlight suspicious patterns.
```

**🔗 Find broken hooks** — Audit your hook chains across all queues.
```
Connect to Rossum and list all hooks. Group them by queue and flag any that are inactive,
have no queues attached, or have a broken run_after chain.
```

**📊 Spot missing indexes** — Catch Data Storage performance problems before they bite.
```
Connect to Rossum and check all Data Storage collections. List their indexes and search
indexes, flag any missing __dynamic_index or duplicate/redundant indexes.
```

**🎯 Tune fuzzy matching** — Optimize MDH search scores with real data.
```
Connect to Rossum and find the $search query in the MDH matching extension. Verify and
calibrate the score thresholds against real data in the collection. Use at least 1000 samples.
```

**🔀 Detect schema drift** — Find fields that diverged across queues.
```
Connect to Rossum and compare schemas across all active queues. List fields that exist in
one schema but not another.
```
